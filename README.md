# Trends in Urban Heat Island Strength Across Major US Cities


### Project Overview:

This project investigates trends in Urban Heat Island strength across 5 major U.S. Cities (New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Seattle), using ERA5 reanalysis data of mean 2m temperatures between 1950 and 2024.  This project quantifies trends in both rural and urban summertime temperatures and evaluates the increase of the Urban Heat Island Index (UHI) in the context of climate change.
